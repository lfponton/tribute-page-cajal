            <h3 class="headline">Ramón y Cajal's Hand-Drawings</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Ramón y Cajal was born in 1852 in Navarra, Spain, in the town of Petilla de Aragón. He was eight years younger than Nietzsche, and at the time of the Spaniard’s birth and early childhood, Darwin was in Downe, a few miles south of London, working on his magnum opus, Origin of Species. Ramón y Cajal did not originally intend to study biology; he had always dreamed of becoming a painter.</p>
                <p>He became a doctor at the age of twenty-one and in 1892, he joined the faculty of the Complutense University of Madrid. At that time, it was not yet possible to do research on living brains, so he Cajal had to make do with the examination of dead brains.
                </p>
                <p>His main contribution to modern neuroscience is known as the neuron doctrine. This consists of two main insights: that every neuron in the brain is separate and that neurons communicate across synapses.
                </p>
                <p>Long before the synapse was visible, Cajal’s neuron doctrine had transformed scientists’ understanding of the nervous system. He carefully sketched out the brain in thousands of stunning pen-and-ink diagrams, which proved to be powerful tools for persuasively communicating his vision to the scientific world.

                    "Like the entomologist in pursuit of brightly colored butterflies, my attention hunted, in the flower garden of the gray matter [the cerebral cortex], cells with delicate and elegant forms, the mysterious butterflies of the soul, the beating of whose wings may someday — who knows? — clarify the secret of mental life."
